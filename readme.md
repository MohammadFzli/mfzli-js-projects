# Add,Delete,Edit, an object and sort by Name all objects in the Array written in TS

In this project, I defined UserType using variable definition in TypeScript and using js and ts commands to create multiple objects with first name, last name, age, occupation, marital status, gender, height, weight, ID and phone number. For a different presentation, I defined test users.

The first addUser function: In this function, I used the push function to add a new user.

The second updateUser function: In this function, I requested the desired ID using the findindex function and stored it inside a variable called userIndex, which uses userIndex to find the desired object number for updating and then replace the information.

The third removeUser function: this function also finds the ID we want to remove using the findindex function and stores it in the userIndex variable, then using the splice function that takes two input values (presentation index and the number of removals from the presentation), finds and deletes the desired user.

The fourth function sortByName: This function can receive the comparison function using the sort function as input and use the localeCompare function to sort the names alphabetically.
