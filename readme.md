# ToDO written with tailwind, flowbite in ts. and module ts codes
In this project, we designed the html page using tailwind and flowbite, and by pressing the show button, we get the information of the input tags, and by pressing the show contact button, we display the obtained information in a floating window that can be closed. . .
